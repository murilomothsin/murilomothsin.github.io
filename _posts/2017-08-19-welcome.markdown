Welcome to my personal blog. Here, Iâ€™ll expose my arguments and articles about technology, programming and a life as a programmer.

I code to live for over 6 years, with 4+ years working with Ruby on Rails. My focus is to develop systems with real impact in people life, making the difference through software and tech.

I already worked with PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, CakePHP, React, Kubernetes, docker and so on. But I believe that regardless the language or framework, the important to the project's success is thinking a lot about how to do it and if I need to do something, probaly someone already do and maybe do it better than me, so research.
